I implemented comments for my blog posts using a tool called Disqus. You have to register an account on their website and configure your new site. Then you'll get an url that you can paste inside your code on the jekyll project so you enable users to comment on your posts.

OpenGraph is a tech created by facebook, that allows integration between Facebook and its user data and a website. By adding Open graph tags to your page content, you can identify which elements of your page you want to show when someone shares your website.
The og:image tage specifies what image to show when someone shares your page on facebook.
I use open graph to show the title, url, type and image when someone share my posts page to facebook.
