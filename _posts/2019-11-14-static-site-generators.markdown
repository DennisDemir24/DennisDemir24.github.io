Statis site generators are a great tool to get a blog or website up and running fast. You can use static site generators with a headless CMS, you can even use it with Wordpress. The most popular ssg is Gatsby. Gatsby is based on React, a tool that facebook built to make it easier and faster to build web apps. 
The perks of a ssg is, quick build capability with the use of templates and markdown.
It's fast, and it's easy to publish the site.
You can easily integrate sass into a ssg.
You can also add in javascript to make the pages dynamic.

You should not use a SSG when you build a larger site. But you could use it as a frontend for a webapp.
