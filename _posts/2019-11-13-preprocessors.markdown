To compare a css-preprocessor over regular css is that you don't really need it for smaller web projects or apps.
But once the application gets bigger and more complex, the CSS code get harder to read and maintain.
It's more difficult to structure the code, you will have endelss lines of CSS classes and rules.
A preprocessor, like sass helps you deal with these kind of problems.
To make it clearer, a CSS preprocessor is a program/tool that has its own syntax which gets compiled into standard CSS code.
Sass, the preprocessors i used in my project and I also use it daily in my work, is the most used CSS preprocessor.
You can use variables in Sass, but in the newer version of CSS you can also use variables.
One thing that standard CSS is not using is nesting of classes. You can write a class inside of another class.
When the project gets bigger the readability gets easier when you can use nesting.
I used sass for this project, because i like it, and I have some experience using it. It was easy to start with because it were already pre-configured in the project.

Pros
-Nesting of classes.
-Mixins(Like a function that groups a set of rules together.)
-Imports(Which now have support in standard CSS.)

Cons
-More setup and tools to use.
-Harder to debug when you nest many classes.


I don't think CSS pre-processor are going anywhere anytime soon. They extend the basic features of CSS and can help you improve your work, and It's also a great tool to have in your toolbelt.
